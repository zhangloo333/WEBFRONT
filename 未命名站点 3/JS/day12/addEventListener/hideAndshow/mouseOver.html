        The incident occurred at Spring Valley High School in Columbia when the unnamed student refused to leave class.

        Video shows the officer knocking her down and pulling her across the floor.

        The officer, Ben Fields, has been placed on leave and there has been an outcry from various civil rights and parents' groups.

        Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott, who asked for federal help to investigate, said he wanted to avoid a "conflict of interest".

        The FBI, which will carry out the probe, said in a statement it would "collect all available facts and evidence".

        The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division will assist in the investigation as well
